# React First Application

Welcome in my Home Sale App üè† !

## Run the application

You can preview it on [Vercel](https://first-react-app-gamma-two.vercel.app/).

Or to run locally use :

``` code
git clone https://github.com/Friedrich482/first-react-app.git
```

After that, go in the root of the project and install all dependencies by using :

``` code
npm install
```

And finally to serve the project locally, use the command :

``` code
npm run dev
```

After that open ```localhost:5173``` to see the result.
